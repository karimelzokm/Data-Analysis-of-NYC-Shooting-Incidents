# Data-Analysis-of-NYC-Shooting-Incidents

This is my analysis of shooting incidents in New York City. I use Python and data science libraries like Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to generate insights on this data to answer specific questions/hypotheses presented in the Jupyter Notebook. The dataset is automatically downloaded from online in the notebook. Most of the summary/documentation is integrated within the Jupyter notebook and the code itself. Thank you!
